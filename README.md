# Advent of code 2023

We want to participate with https://adventofcode.com/2023/about using if you can TypeScript as we use it in our projects EMX2 and Armadillo.

## Typescript

We will use https://deno.com as that is a one shot develop and run tool. So TypeScript saffies don't need the whole plumbing of node, npm, etc.

### Download and install

- your favourite text editor Codium, VSCode has Deno support
- https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation (using brew, winget, etc)
- you can configure to run the current file

## Puzzles

The puzzles appear on https://adventofcode.com/2023 at 6:00 but we will gather together from 10:00-11:00 each day on our slack channel.

A puzzle has test values in the running text and a download containing the real puzzel data.

Each day you have 2 challenges. The second part has new text and tests.

To keep organised make a 2-digit day folder containing code and download.
